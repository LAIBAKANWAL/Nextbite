# üöÄ Deploy Your Project to Vercel - Website Method

## Overview
Your project is ready for deployment! You have:
- ‚úÖ Frontend (Vite-based React app)
- ‚úÖ Backend API endpoints
- ‚úÖ Vercel configuration file (`vercel.json`)
- ‚úÖ GitHub repository: `https://github.com/LAIBAKANWAL/Nextbite`

## Step-by-Step Deployment Guide

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Website
1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to: **https://vercel.com**
3. Click **"Get Started for Free"** or **"Login"** if you have an account

### Step 2: Sign Up/Login
**If you don't have an account:**
- Click **"Sign up"**
- Choose **"Continue with GitHub"** (recommended since your code is on GitHub)
- Authorize Vercel to access your GitHub account

**If you already have an account:**
- Click **"Login"**
- Use your credentials or GitHub login

### Step 3: Import Your Project
1. Once logged in, you'll see the Vercel dashboard
2. Click **"New Project"** or **"Add New..."** ‚Üí **"Project"**
3. You'll see a list of your GitHub repositories
4. Find **"LAIBAKANWAL/Nextbite"** in the list
5. Click **"Import"** next to your repository

### Step 4: Configure Project Settings
Vercel will automatically detect your project configuration from `vercel.json`, but verify these settings:

**Project Settings:**
- **Project Name**: `nextbite` (or customize as you prefer)
- **Framework Preset**: Should auto-detect as "Other" or "Vite"
- **Root Directory**: Leave as `./` (root)

**Build Settings:**
- **Build Command**: `npm run build --prefix frontend` (should be auto-filled)
- **Output Directory**: `frontend/dist` (should be auto-filled)
- **Install Command**: `npm install --prefix frontend && npm install --prefix api` (should be auto-filled)

### Step 5: Environment Variables (if needed)
If your project uses environment variables:
1. Click **"Environment Variables"**
2. Add any required variables (like API keys, database URLs, etc.)
3. Set the environment to **"Production"**

### Step 6: Deploy!
1. Review all settings
2. Click **"Deploy"**
3. Wait for the deployment to complete (usually 1-3 minutes)

### Step 7: Access Your Deployed App
Once deployment is complete:
1. You'll see a success screen with your live URL
2. Your app will be available at: `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`
3. You'll also get a custom domain that you can share

## üîÑ Automatic Deployments

**Great news!** After the initial deployment:
- Every time you push to your main branch, Vercel will automatically redeploy
- Pull requests will get preview deployments
- You can see all deployments in your Vercel dashboard

## üìã Your Project Structure (Already Optimized)

Your `vercel.json` is already configured for:
- ‚úÖ Frontend static build from `frontend/` directory
- ‚úÖ API functions from `api/` directory  
- ‚úÖ Proper routing for both frontend and API
- ‚úÖ CORS headers for API endpoints
- ‚úÖ Production environment settings

## üõ†Ô∏è Post-Deployment Steps

### 1. Test Your Deployment
- Visit your deployed URL
- Test all frontend functionality
- Test API endpoints (they'll be at `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/...`)

### 2. Custom Domain (Optional)
1. Go to your project dashboard on Vercel
2. Click **"Domains"**
3. Add your custom domain if you have one

### 3. Monitor Performance
- Use Vercel's built-in analytics
- Check the **"Functions"** tab for API performance
- Monitor build times and deployment logs

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions:

**Build Fails:**
- Check that all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Ensure build commands are correct
- Review build logs in Vercel dashboard

**API Not Working:**
- Verify API files are in the `api/` directory
